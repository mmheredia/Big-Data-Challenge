# Big Data Challenge - "Alexa, can you handle big data?"

## Background

Many of Amazon's shoppers depend on product reviews to make a purchase. Amazon makes these datasets publicly available. However, they can be quite large and can exceed the capacity of local machines to handle. One dataset alone contains over 1.5 million rows; with over 40 datasets, which can be quite taxing on the average local computer.

The goal of this project was to perform ETL completely in the cloud and upload a DataFrame to an RDS instance.
